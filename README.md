# The Gigrig Power Supply Diagram Generator

[The Gigrig](http://www.thegigrig.com) is a great company for the modern guitarist. It provides a
whole array of superb solutions for all things pedalboard. One of
those solutions is how to supply them with power. The Gigrig's modular
power supply system is incredible extensible. This might be a hassle
to figure out what you exactly need. That's why this thing exists:
it's a web-based diagram generator that builds a power supply path for
your pedals.

This is also available for preview using Github Pages. Check it out here:
